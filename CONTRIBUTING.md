# Contributing to Reddit Affiliate Marketing Automation

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

### Pull Requests

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

### Coding Style

We use ESLint for TypeScript code quality and follow a few key principles:

- Use the shadcn UI component library for UI components
- Follow the existing patterns in the codebase
- Write clear, descriptive variable and function names
- Add comments for complex logic

## Testing

We use Vitest and React Testing Library for testing. Please write tests for new code you create.

## Project Structure

Keep the existing project structure:

- Frontend code goes in the `client` directory
- Backend code goes in the `server` directory
- Shared types go in the `shared` directory
- Tests go in the `tests` directory

## Issue Reporting

Use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by opening a new issue.

### Bug Reports

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

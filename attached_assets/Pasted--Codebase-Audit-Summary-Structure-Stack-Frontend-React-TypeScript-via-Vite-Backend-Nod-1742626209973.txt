🔍 Codebase Audit Summary
🗂 Structure & Stack
Frontend: React + TypeScript (via Vite)

Backend: Node.js + Express + TypeScript

Scheduling: Custom in-memory job runner for Reddit posts

AI: OpenAI integration via SDK

Testing: Vitest + React Testing Library (partially implemented)

Data: In-memory store (no persistent DB yet)

CI/CD: GitHub Actions not yet configured (but ready)

Reddit API: Integrated via snoowrap or custom API layer

🚧 MVP Feature Coverage (as of now)
Feature	Status	Notes
Reddit OAuth + API posting	✅ Working	Posts are being scheduled and published successfully
AI Content generation (OpenAI)	✅ Working	Prompt templating and content generation exist
Post Queue & Scheduler	✅ Basic	In-memory only — works, but not persistent
Frontend Dashboard (Post creation/status)	✅ Partial	UI is in place, but not fully styled or robust
Flair/Tag selection	❌ Missing	Needed for subreddit-specific posting
Subreddit-specific rule validation	❌ Missing	To prevent rejected posts or bans
Persistent storage (DB or local JSON)	❌ Missing	Queue resets on restart — MVP blocker for reliability
Error tracking / logging	❌ Missing	No sentry/logging hooks yet for failsafe ops
Auth / Multi-user handling	❌ Out of Scope	Only needed if SaaS-ing it
🚀 Recommended MVP Roadmap
✅ Sprint 1 – MVP Completion (~3 days)
 Replace in-memory queue with persistent storage (JSON or SQLite)

 Add flair selection support (UI + API call)

 Add minimal subreddit rule checker (hardcoded rules per subreddit)

 Basic error handling + logging (console.error at minimum)

 Polish UI: preview post format, copy markdown

✅ Sprint 2 – Polish + Launch (~3–5 days)
 Add GitHub Actions CI (lint + test)

 Auto-format code (Prettier + ESLint)

 Finalize Vitest coverage for:

 Scheduler

 AI generator

 Post submit logic

 Deploy MVP to Replit or small VPS

 Create “Reset Scheduler” / Admin control UI

🛠 Suggestions for Shipping Faster
Temporary shortcuts to unblock dev:
✅ Store queued posts in a local posts.json

✅ Use a subredditConfig.ts file to define flairs/rules per subreddit

✅ Use setInterval() for scheduler if Replit doesn’t run long-lived processes reliably

📦 Next Deliverables I Can Provide:
✅ posts.json storage module

✅ Example flair config system

✅ Minimal GitHub Action for lint/test

✅ Updated test files for scheduler & OpenAI

Would you like me to start creating those files now and drop them into your Replit environment or repo directly?

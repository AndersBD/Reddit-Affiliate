ROLE: Senior Full-Stack Product Engineer
TASK: Application State Review & MVP Feature Planning

CONTEXT:

Current project: Reddit Affiliate Scheduler
Tech Stack: Node.js (Express, TypeScript), React (Vite), PostgreSQL (via pg)
Key features:
AI-powered content generation using OpenAI
Reddit post scheduling system
In-memory storage successfully migrated to PostgreSQL
Hosting: Running on Replit, future migration to Hetzner or Coolify
Dev tooling: ESLint, Prettier, Vitest in place; Prisma not yet implemented
CI: GitHub integration established, but no workflows active yet
REQUIRED ANALYSIS:

Summarize your current understanding of the application’s structure and functionality
Identify which features are fully implemented vs. partial or missing
Propose the next 3–5 core MVP features to build for launch
Suggest technical or architectural upgrades (e.g., retries, flair config, multi-user support)
Recommend any cleanup or dev tooling improvements (e.g., tests, CI, docs)
OUTPUT FORMAT:

Product summary: What the app does and how it works (≤ 300 words)
Feature completion status:
Fully implemented
In progress
Missing
Suggested next features (priority-ordered list with short justification)
Technical enhancement recommendations (including DB, testing, or deployment)
Optional: Rough sprint roadmap (1–2 weeks, organized by dev priority)
CONSTRAINTS:

Suggestions must be scoped realistically for a lean MVP
Maintain Reddit API compliance and avoid overengineering
Must assume deployment on low-cost infrastructure (Replit or Coolify)
NOTE:
You should use your current codebase awareness to answer, not guess. This will guide our development focus over the next 1–2 sprints.

Based on the codebase analysis, here's a comprehensive review of the Reddit Affiliate Scheduler application:

PRODUCT SUMMARY:
The application is an AI-powered Reddit affiliate marketing automation platform built with Express/TypeScript backend and React/Vite frontend. It enables users to manage affiliate campaigns, generate AI-optimized content using OpenAI, schedule Reddit posts, and monitor performance metrics. The system uses PostgreSQL for data persistence and includes comprehensive schema definitions for affiliate programs, campaigns, posts, and metrics tracking.

FEATURE COMPLETION STATUS:

Fully Implemented:

Database schema and storage layer (PostgreSQL integration)
Basic Express API routes and endpoints
Frontend UI components and layout
Dark/light theme support
GitHub sync automation
In Progress:

Reddit API integration (authentication setup exists)
Post scheduling system (basic structure present)
Content generation with OpenAI (endpoints defined)
Campaign management UI
Missing:

Rate limiting implementation
Error handling and retries
User authentication/authorization
Compliance monitoring system
Analytics dashboard data integration
NEXT CORE MVP FEATURES (Priority Order):

Complete Reddit Authentication Flow
Implement OAuth2 flow with Reddit API
Add token refresh mechanism
Store credentials securely in Replit Secrets
Post Scheduler Core Logic
Implement job queue for scheduled posts
Add retry mechanism for failed posts
Basic error reporting
Content Generation & Compliance
Complete OpenAI integration
Add content validation against Reddit rules
Basic sentiment analysis for safety
Basic Analytics Dashboard
Track post performance metrics
Click-through monitoring
Basic conversion tracking
TECHNICAL RECOMMENDATIONS:

Database Optimization
Add database migrations
Implement connection pooling
Add basic caching layer
Testing Infrastructure
Add unit tests for core services
Integration tests for Reddit API
E2E tests for critical flows
Error Handling
Implement global error handler
Add structured logging
Setup basic monitoring
Deployment Configuration
Set deployment build command to
and run command to
This creates a comprehensive foundation while maintaining a lean MVP approach. Would you like me to focus on implementing any specific feature from this analysis?

Save this analysis in your memory and devise an overall plan so that we can reach an end goal of a fully functional MVP solution that can schedule and post on Reddit.

just now
Based on the codebase analysis and current state, I'll devise a plan to achieve a functional MVP. Here's the prioritized roadmap:

Phase 1 - Core Infrastructure (Current Sprint)

Fix the port conflict issue first:
server/index.ts
Setup deployment configuration:
Set deployment build command to
and run command to
Phase 2 - Reddit Integration

Complete Reddit OAuth flow
Implement secure token storage
Add rate limiting
Set up error handling
Phase 3 - Content Generation

Finalize OpenAI integration
Implement content validation
Add compliance checking
Phase 4 - Scheduling System

Complete post scheduling logic
Add retry mechanisms
Implement job queue monitoring
Would you like me to start implementing any specific phase? We should begin with Phase 1 to ensure the core infrastructure is stable before adding features.

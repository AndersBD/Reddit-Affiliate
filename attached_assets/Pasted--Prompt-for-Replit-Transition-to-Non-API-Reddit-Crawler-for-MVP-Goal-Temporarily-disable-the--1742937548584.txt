✅ Prompt for Replit: Transition to Non-API Reddit Crawler for MVP
🧠 Goal: Temporarily disable the Reddit API-based integration and replace it with a lightweight, API-free Reddit crawler for MVP use. The crawler should discover content opportunities by scraping Reddit HTML and match them to affiliate keywords.
We want to preserve all Reddit API-related code for future use (comment it out or move it to a dedicated folder), but switch to a simpler MVP solution that doesn't require API credentials or authentication.
________________________________________
🔧 Here's what needs to be done:
1. Fork or Move Existing Reddit API Code
•	Move all API-related logic into a separate folder (suggested: server/services/api-reddit/)
o	Files to move:
	server/services/redditAuth.ts
	server/services/reddit-fetcher.ts
	API routes from server/routes/index.ts like /auth/reddit, /reddit/..., etc.
•	Update routes.ts to comment out or conditionally disable Reddit API routes.
•	Maintain comments indicating: “Preserved for full API integration in future phase.”
2. Implement Python-Based HTML Reddit Crawler
•	Add a new crawler/ folder in the project root.
•	Add a Python script: reddit_crawler.py that:
o	Scrapes hot, new, top threads from each target subreddit (from DB or config file).
o	Extracts: title, body, subreddit, upvotes, comment count, flair, timestamp, link.
o	Filters threads using keywords from affiliate program tags.
o	Saves results to JSON or SQLite file (data/opportunities.json or .sqlite).
3. Replace Backend Thread Source (Temporarily)
•	Instead of calling Reddit API for opportunities, have the backend read from data/opportunities.json (populated by the crawler).
•	Create a function like loadLocalOpportunities() and expose it via:
o	GET /api/opportunities — returns locally scraped + matched Reddit posts
•	This lets the frontend work unchanged — just gets data from a different source.
4. Wire Crawler into Replit App Lifecycle (Optional)
•	Add a CRON-like scheduled call or manual trigger to run the crawler every few hours (e.g., using subprocess in Node or Shell script).
•	Optional: add an admin-only UI button in Content Library to manually run the scraper.
5. (Optional) Add Google SERP Checker
•	For each matched Reddit thread:
o	Google search: "site:reddit.com {thread_title}"
o	If URL is found in top 10 results, mark serp_match: true
o	Store that in the local opportunity data.
•	Use playwright-python for SERP scraping (headless, undetectable, works well).

🧠 Strategy Summary
Step	What You’re Doing
✅ Preserve	Move Reddit API integration into /api-reddit/ for future use
🧼 Disable	Comment out Reddit API routes + remove API dependency temporarily
⚡ Replace	Use Python-based crawler to fetch & score Reddit posts
🔁 Reuse	Plug crawler output into existing UI/API
🛠 Build on	Add SERP checker + opportunity scoring next
🧠 Goal:
Build a local system that:
1.	Scrapes Reddit threads from curated subreddits (API-free crawler).
2.	Classifies intent + affiliate match (using keyword scoring).
3.	Scrapes Google SERPs for keywords like "site:reddit.com Jasper AI review".
4.	Cross-checks: Is the Reddit thread ranking in Google? If yes, high opportunity.
5.	Outputs opportunity reports for you to comment/post.

🧱 System Breakdown: Phase 1 MVP (Local, Python-Based)
📦 1. Reddit Crawler (No API)
•	✅ Scrape new, hot, or top threads from handpicked subreddits
•	Extract:
o	Title, selftext, upvotes, timestamp, flair, link
•	Store in: opportunities_raw.sqlite or .json
Tech: requests, BeautifulSoup, sqlite3
________________________________________
🎯 2. Intent + Affiliate Match Engine
•	For each thread:
o	Classify:
	DISCOVERY → "What's the best AI writer?"
	COMPARISON → "Jasper vs Writesonic?"
	SHOWCASE, QUESTION, etc.
o	Match:
	Look for keywords like “Frase,” “Jasper,” “AI writer,” “SEO tool”
	Map to affiliate program metadata (link + promo code)
•	Score:
o	Intent + affiliate relevance = Opportunity score (0–100)
Tech: Python dicts, regex/keyword rules, or even GPT if needed later
________________________________________
🌐 3. Google SERP Checker (Headless Browser)
•	For each high-score Reddit thread (or keyword), Google:
o	"site:reddit.com Jasper AI review"
o	"best AI writer site:reddit.com"
•	Scrape top 10 results:
o	Check if any of the scraped Reddit thread URLs are in the results
•	If found → mark as SERP Opportunity
Tech:
•	Use playwright (faster than Selenium) or serpapi (if you want to avoid scraping)
•	Store ranking match as is_on_google = True + rank position
________________________________________
🧪 4. Opportunity Report Generator
•	Export as .csv, .json, or SQLite dashboard with:
json
CopyEdit
{
  "thread_title": "Jasper vs Copy AI?",
  "subreddit": "r/Blogging",
  "intent": "COMPARISON",
  "affiliate_match": ["Jasper AI", "Copy AI"],
  "opportunity_score": 87,
  "google_rank_match": true,
  "rank_position": 4,
  "action": "Post comment with Jasper link + promo"
}
________________________________________
🖥 5. Local Dashboard or CLI View
•	Option 1: CLI viewer with filtering
•	Option 2: Jupyter notebook table
•	Option 3: (Later) Replit React frontend connected to this system via a lightweight API
________________________________________
⚡ Bonus Logic: Comment Generator (Next Step)
•	For DISCOVERY posts:
“I’ve used Jasper and Writesonic. Jasper is better for long-form SEO — here’s a 20% code if you’re curious: [your link]”
•	For COMPARISON:
“I’ve compared both. If you care about SEO briefs, Frase is 🔥 — I’ve been using it since 2023 (affiliate)”
Use variables: {tool_name}, {use_case}, {link}, {promo_code}

🛡️ Compliance & Ethics
•	No Reddit login
•	No automated posting
•	No mass crawling (spread requests over time, cache results)
This is all read-only intelligence with manual posting. Totally fair.

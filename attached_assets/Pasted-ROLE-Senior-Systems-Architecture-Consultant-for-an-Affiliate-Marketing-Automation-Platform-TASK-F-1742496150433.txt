TASK: Full-Scale System Design & Implementation Plan
CONTEXT:

o	Monthly budget of max $300 for tools/APIs.
•	Requirements: 
o	99.9% uptime to handle scheduling and analytics.
o	Must obey Reddit’s terms of service (no spam or manipulative upvoting).
o	Must track affiliate performance, integrate with affiliate dashboards, provide ROI reports.
REQUIRED ANALYSIS:
1.	Core functionality & architecture for automating Reddit posting, comment generation, scheduling, and tracking performance metrics.
2.	Use of AI (e.g., GPT) for content generation, ensuring authenticity and compliance.
3.	Cost breakdown of third-party integrations (schedulers, analytics, affiliate networks), within a $300/month budget.
4.	Security and compliance with Reddit API terms, user data privacy, and anti-spam regulations.
5.	Roadmap from MVP to a fully automated, scalable platform.
OUTPUT FORMAT:
1.	Executive brief (250 words): Summarize the overall system proposal for C-level stakeholders, focusing on the benefits, ROI, and strategic impact.
2.	Technical details (500 words): Deep-dive into the architecture (frontend, backend, databases, integrations, AI modules).
3.	Risk matrix: Identify possible failure points (e.g., subreddit bans, AI content detection, scheduling conflicts), with severity and mitigation strategies.
4.	Timeline visualization: Gantt chart or phased plan showing project milestones from development to deployment (estimated 6–12 months).
5.	Budget breakdown: Outline of costs (hosting, AI API usage, third-party tools, developer hours) with justification to stay at or below $300/month for running expenses.
CONSTRAINTS:
•	Operational Continuity: Platform must run daily schedules reliably, with minimal downtime to avoid missed postings.
•	Ethical & Compliance: Must adhere to Reddit’s TOS, no vote manipulation, minimal risk of spam detection.
•	Time Frame: Deliver working MVP within 3 months, full rollout by 12 months.
•	Scalability: Architecture should handle growth up to 5× user load for future expansions.

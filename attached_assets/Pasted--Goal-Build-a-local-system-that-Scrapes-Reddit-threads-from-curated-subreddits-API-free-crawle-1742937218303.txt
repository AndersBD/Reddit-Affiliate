🧠 Goal:
Build a local system that:

Scrapes Reddit threads from curated subreddits (API-free crawler).

Classifies intent + affiliate match (using keyword scoring).

Scrapes Google SERPs for keywords like "site:reddit.com Jasper AI review".

Cross-checks: Is the Reddit thread ranking in Google? If yes, high opportunity.

Outputs opportunity reports for you to comment/post.

🧱 System Breakdown: Phase 1 MVP (Local, Python-Based)
📦 1. Reddit Crawler (No API)
✅ Scrape new, hot, or top threads from handpicked subreddits

Extract:

Title, selftext, upvotes, timestamp, flair, link

Store in: opportunities_raw.sqlite or .json

Tech: requests, BeautifulSoup, sqlite3

🎯 2. Intent + Affiliate Match Engine
For each thread:

Classify:

DISCOVERY → "What's the best AI writer?"

COMPARISON → "Jasper vs Writesonic?"

SHOWCASE, QUESTION, etc.

Match:

Look for keywords like “Frase,” “Jasper,” “AI writer,” “SEO tool”

Map to affiliate program metadata (link + promo code)

Score:

Intent + affiliate relevance = Opportunity score (0–100)

Tech: Python dicts, regex/keyword rules, or even GPT if needed later

🌐 3. Google SERP Checker (Headless Browser)
For each high-score Reddit thread (or keyword), Google:

"site:reddit.com Jasper AI review"

"best AI writer site:reddit.com"

Scrape top 10 results:

Check if any of the scraped Reddit thread URLs are in the results

If found → mark as SERP Opportunity

Tech:

Use playwright (faster than Selenium) or serpapi (if you want to avoid scraping)

Store ranking match as is_on_google = True + rank position

🧪 4. Opportunity Report Generator
Export as .csv, .json, or SQLite dashboard with:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "thread_title": "Jasper vs Copy AI?",
  "subreddit": "r/Blogging",
  "intent": "COMPARISON",
  "affiliate_match": ["Jasper AI", "Copy AI"],
  "opportunity_score": 87,
  "google_rank_match": true,
  "rank_position": 4,
  "action": "Post comment with Jasper link + promo"
}
🖥 5. Local Dashboard or CLI View
Option 1: CLI viewer with filtering

Option 2: Jupyter notebook table

Option 3: (Later) Replit React frontend connected to this system via a lightweight API

⚡ Bonus Logic: Comment Generator (Next Step)
For DISCOVERY posts:

“I’ve used Jasper and Writesonic. Jasper is better for long-form SEO — here’s a 20% code if you’re curious: [your link]”

For COMPARISON:

“I’ve compared both. If you care about SEO briefs, Frase is 🔥 — I’ve been using it since 2023 (affiliate)”

Use variables: {tool_name}, {use_case}, {link}, {promo_code}

🚀 MVP Workflow
bash

# 1. Scrape Reddit Threads
$ python reddit_crawler.py

# 2. Analyze threads for intent + affiliate matches
$ python affiliate_matcher.py

# 3. Cross-check which rank on Google
$ python google_serp_checker.py

# 4. Export opportunity report
$ python report_generator.py
🛡️ Compliance & Ethics
No Reddit login

No automated posting

No mass crawling (spread requests over time, cache results)

This is all read-only intelligence with manual posting. Totally fair.

✅ TL;DR: MVP Plan
Component	Status	Tooling
Reddit Crawler	✅ Easy	Python + BeautifulSoup
Intent Classifier	✅ Easy-Mid	Regex or GPT (later)
Affiliate Matcher	✅ Easy	Keyword-based
Google Rank Checker	✅ Mid	Playwright or SerpAPI
Report Generator	✅ Easy	JSON/CSV
Dashboard	🟡 Optional	Jupyter or React (Phase 2)

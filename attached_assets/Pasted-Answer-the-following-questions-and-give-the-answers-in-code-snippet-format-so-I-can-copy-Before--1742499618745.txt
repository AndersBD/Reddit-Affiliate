Answer the following questions and give the answers in code snippet format so I can copy.

Before implementing any changes in my application, I'll ensure 100% readiness by completing this assessment:

{
  "observe": {
    "application_state": "Describe the current state of your application and the specific component experiencing issues",
    "environment_details": "What is the deployment environment, browser/device context, and user scenario?",
    "error_symptoms": "What specific errors or unexpected behaviors are occurring?",
    "reproduction_steps": "What exact sequence of actions triggers this issue?",
    "recent_changes": "What changes were made to the application prior to this issue appearing?"
  },
  
  "orient": {
    "pattern_recognition": "Does this issue resemble any known patterns or previous problems?",
    "component_interactions": "How might the interactions between components contribute to this issue?",
    "platform_specific_factors": "Are there any platform-specific features or limitations that might be relevant?",
    "data_flow_analysis": "How is data flowing through the system at the point of failure?",
    "hypotheses": "What are the most likely causes of this issue, ranked by probability?"
  },
  
  "decide": {
    "solution_options": "What potential solutions could address the most likely causes?",
    "tradeoff_analysis": "What are the tradeoffs (complexity, time, risk) for each solution?",
    "implementation_approach": "Should this be fixed with a quick patch or a more comprehensive refactor?",
    "testing_strategy": "How will you verify that the solution actually resolves the issue?",
    "selected_solution": "Which solution provides the best balance of effectiveness and safety?"
  },
  
  "act": {
    "implementation_plan": "What specific code changes need to be made and in what order?",
    "fallback_preparation": "What rollback plan will you have ready if the solution causes problems?",
    "verification_steps": "What exact tests will confirm the issue is resolved?",
    "documentation_updates": "What documentation needs to be updated to reflect this fix?",
    "knowledge_sharing": "How will you share what you've learned to prevent similar issues?"
  },
  
  "final_readiness_assessment": "Based on all the above, am I 100% ready to proceed safely?"

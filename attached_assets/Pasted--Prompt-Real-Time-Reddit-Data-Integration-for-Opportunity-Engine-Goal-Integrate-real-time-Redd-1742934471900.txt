âœ… Prompt: Real-Time Reddit Data Integration for Opportunity Engine
ðŸ§  Goal: Integrate real-time Reddit data into the opportunity analysis pipeline so that the platform continually discovers fresh threads across our mapped subreddits and evaluates them in near real-time.

ðŸ”§ Scope:
Implement a system that fetches live Reddit threads via the Reddit API and pipes them into the opportunity analyzer for scoring and affiliate matching.

ðŸ§± Functional Requirements:
1. Live Thread Fetcher
Use Redditâ€™s official API (via OAuth2) to:

Pull new or hot threads from each subreddit listed in our SubredditCategoryMap.

Support configurable parameters:

Number of threads (default: 50 per subreddit)

Sort mode (e.g., new, hot, top)

Store results with:

ts
Copy
Edit
{
  id: string,
  subreddit: string,
  title: string,
  body: string,
  author: string,
  flair: string | null,
  upvotes: number,
  comments: number,
  created_utc: number
}
2. Thread Enrichment & Processing
For each thread:

Run it through the existing intent classification system (DISCOVERY, COMPARISON, etc.)

Score it via the opportunity analyzer

Match it with affiliate programs based on keyword relevance and tags

3. Real-Time Insertion into Opportunity Table
Store enriched results in the Opportunities table

Include:

Matched affiliate programs (with link + promo_code)

Suggested action (comment, create_post, monitor)

Thread intent + confidence score

4. Scheduled or On-Demand Execution
Allow this fetch+analyze process to run:

On-demand via API endpoint (/api/fetch-opportunities)

On schedule (e.g., every 6 hours via CRON job)

ðŸ–¥ API Endpoint Example
POST /api/fetch-opportunities

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "subreddits": ["r/ChatGPT", "r/Blogging", "r/SEO"],
  "mode": "hot",
  "limit": 25
}
Response should return opportunity results ready for rendering in the frontend.

ðŸ§ª Optional (Advanced for Later):
Store Reddit post ID to avoid duplicate analysis

Allow filtering by min_upvotes or flair

Expand to include Pushshift.io for historical data later

🚀 Prompt: Enable Reddit Content Discovery + Opportunity Mining
🎯 Goal: Begin real-time Reddit content research based on the 200+ mapped subreddits and tagged affiliate programs.

🧱 Core Capabilities to Build:

1. Reddit Post Crawler (via Reddit API or Pushshift)
Pull the latest 100–200 threads per subreddit (limit via subreddit.limit)

Store:

Title

Body (selftext)

Upvotes, Comments, Flair

Posted Date, Author

2. Thread Intent Detection
For each pulled thread, auto-classify:

“Intent”:

💡 DISCOVERY: “What’s the best AI writer?”

🤔 COMPARISON: “Jasper vs Koala AI?”

🚀 SHOWCASE: “Here’s how I used Pictory AI for YouTube”

❓ QUESTION: “How do you automate LinkedIn outreach?”

Optional: Use keyword-matching or LLM model (GPT call) for intent classification

3. Affiliate Match Scoring
For each thread, determine:

✅ Affiliate Relevance Score (0–100) based on:

Keyword overlap with affiliate tags (e.g., “Jasper” in AI Writer threads)

Product category match (e.g., AI video + Pictory)

🔗 Suggested affiliate programs to insert (up to 3 per thread)

4. Opportunity Tracker Output

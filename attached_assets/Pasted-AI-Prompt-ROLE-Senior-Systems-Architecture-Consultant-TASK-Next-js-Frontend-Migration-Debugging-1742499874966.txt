TASK: Next.js Frontend Migration & Debugging Analysis

CONTEXT:

A React-based web application is experiencing bugs and performance issues.
Goal: Migrate or refactor the React frontend into a Next.js framework for improved stability, SEO, and maintainability.
Current user base: ~500 daily users.
Uptime requirement: 99.99%.
REQUIRED ANALYSIS:

Migration Risks & Mitigation Strategies: Identify technical pitfalls (e.g., routing conflicts, SSR constraints), propose fallback plans.
Cloud vs. Hybrid Options: Evaluate hosting (Vercel, AWS, or a hybrid approach) in the context of Next.js.
Cost-Benefit Analysis: Compare short-term debugging vs. full Next.js migration in terms of developer hours, performance gains, user experience, and TCO.
Implementation Roadmap: Outline a step-by-step plan to fix bugs, unify React components under Next.js, and ensure minimal downtime.
OUTPUT FORMAT:

Executive Brief (250 words): High-level summary for stakeholdersâ€”why Next.js and a robust debugging approach matter, plus expected ROI.
Technical Details (500 words): In-depth explanation of key Next.js features (SSR, dynamic routing, serverless functions), debugging methods, build pipeline changes, and data-fetching strategies.
Risk Matrix: Potential issues (e.g., SEO disruption, codebase incompatibility, deployment errors) with severity levels and contingency measures.
Timeline Visualization: Gantt or phased rollout for the entire debugging + migration effort, from initial audits to final deployment.
Budget Breakdown: Developer hours, hosting costs (Vercel/AWS), potential third-party tools for monitoring and error tracking.
CONSTRAINTS:

Must Maintain Operational Continuity: The platform must remain usable during the transition; minimal downtime is paramount.
Compliance: Any user data or third-party integrations must adhere to relevant data privacy requirements.
18-Month Implementation Window: All debugging, refactoring, and final deployment must be completed within 18 months to accommodate future expansion plans.

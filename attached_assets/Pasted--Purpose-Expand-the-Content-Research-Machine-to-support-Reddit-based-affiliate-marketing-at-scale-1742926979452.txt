🧠 Purpose: Expand the Content Research Machine to support Reddit-based affiliate marketing at scale. This upgrade focuses on storing critical affiliate metadata and deeply mapping 200+ subreddits for content targeting, trend analysis, and engagement optimization.

📦 FEATURE 1: AFFILIATE PROGRAM INTELLIGENCE
Integrate a structured system to store affiliate program metadata for use in AI content generation.

Each affiliate program must store the following fields:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "program_name": "Frase",
  "affiliate_link": "https://affiliate.example.com/frase",
  "promo_code": "AI20OFF",
  "tags": ["AI", "Content Marketing", "SEO"]
}
🔁 These fields must be queryable by the content generator module, so that affiliate links and promo codes can be dynamically inserted into Reddit posts, comments, and promotional content.

📥 All affiliate metadata will be imported via a separate CSV or JSON source.

🌐 FEATURE 2: DEEP SUBREDDIT RESEARCH INTEGRATION
You must integrate support for each of the following 200 subreddits. Your goal is to associate each subreddit with:

🧩 Primary topics

🧠 User intent (e.g., tool discovery, review seeking, comparison research)

📌 Content format recommendations (e.g., question-answer, tutorial, listicle, “best X” posts)

🚫 Posting & compliance rules (scraped via Reddit API or defined manually)

📊 Engagement heuristics (e.g., avg upvotes, best post times)

🔍 Keywords to monitor (for targeting intent like “best AI writer”, “referral automation”, “discount code for Notion AI”)

Each subreddit should be stored with a schema like:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "subreddit": "r/ChatGPT",
  "topics": ["ChatGPT", "Prompt Engineering", "LLMs"],
  "user_intent": ["tool discovery", "prompt optimization"],
  "content_formats": ["case study", "Q&A", "tool comparison"],
  "rules": ["No self-promo unless approved", "Flair required"],
  "posting_times": ["Tuesdays 9am EST", "Fridays 12pm EST"],
  "high_value_keywords": ["best ChatGPT plugins", "alternatives to Jasper", "CustomGPT vs ChatGPT"]
}
